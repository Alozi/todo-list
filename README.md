## 🧠 How It Works

- All todos are stored in the browser’s **LocalStorage**
- `useTodos` custom hook manages:
  - adding / editing / deleting / toggling tasks
  - counting completed items
  - clearing completed tasks
- Theme switching handled with **MUI ThemeProvider**
- Progress and confetti controlled via the **Hero** component
